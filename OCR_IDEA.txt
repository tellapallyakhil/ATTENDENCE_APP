# Feature Idea: OCR Student List Import

## Objective
Enable the user to import a list of students by scanning a physical document (JPG/Photo) instead of manual entry.

## Workflow
1. **User Interaction**:
   - User clicks a "Scan List" button in the Manual Attendance screen.
   - User takes a photo of a printed class list or selects one from the gallery.

2. **Processing (OCR)**:
   - The app uses `google_mlkit_text_recognition` to extract raw text from the image.
   - The app applies regex/parsing logic to identify:
     - Student Names (Capitalized words).
     - Registration Numbers (e.g., patterns like 21BCE1001).

3. **Verification & Action**:
   - The app presents the extracted list to the user for confirmation.
   - User selects distinct students or "Add All".
   - The verified students are added to the Firestore database and displayed in the manual attendance list.

## Tech Stack
- `google_mlkit_text_recognition`: For on-device, offline OCR.
- `image_picker`: For camera/gallery access.
